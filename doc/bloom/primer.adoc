= Bloom Filter Primer

:idprefix: primer_

A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure where inserted elements can be looked up
with 100% accuracy, whereas looking up for a non-inserted element may fail with
some probability called the filter's _false positive rate_ or FPR. The tradeoff here is
that Bloom filters occupy much less space than traditional non-probabilistic containers
(typically, around 8-20 bits per element) for an acceptably low FPR. The greater
the filter's _capacity_ (its size in bits), the lower the resulting FPR.

One prime application of Bloom filters and similar data structures is for the prevention
of expensive disk/network accesses when these would fail to retrieve a given piece of
information.
For instance, suppose we are developing a frontend for a database with access time
10 ms and we know 50% of the requests will not succeed (the record does not exist).
Inserting a Bloom filter with a lookup time of 200 ns and a FPR of 0.5% will reduce the
average response time of the system from 10 ms to

[.text-center]
(10 + 0.0002) &times; 50.25% + 0.0002 &times; 49.75% &cong; 5.03 ms, 

that is, we get a &times;1.99 overall speedup. If the database holds 1 billion records,
an in-memory filter with say 8 bits per element will occupy 0.93 GB,
which is perfectly realizable.

In general, Bloom filters are useful to prevent/mitigate queries against large data sets
when exact retrieval is costly and/or can't be made in main memory.
Applications have been described in the areas of web caching,
dictionary compression, network routing and genomics, among others.

provide a rather extensive review of use cases with a focus on networking.

== Implementation

The implementation of a Bloom filter consists of an array of _m_ bits, initially set to zero.
Inserting an element _x_ reduces to selecting _k_ positions pseudorandomly (with the help
of _k_ independent hash functions) and setting them to one.

To check if an element _y_ is in the filter, we follow the same procedure and see if
the selected bits are all set to one. In the example figure there are two unset bits, which
definitely indicates _y_ was not inserted in the filter.

A false positive occurs when the bits checked happen to be all set to one due to
other, unrelated insertions. The probability of having a false positive increases as we
add more elements to the filter, whereas for a given number _n_ of inserted elements, a filter
with greater capacity (larger bit array) will have a lower FPR.
The number _k_ of bits set per operation also affects the FPR, albeit in a more complicated way:
when the array is sparsely populated, a higher value of _k_ improves (decreases) the FPR,
as there are more chances that we hit a non-set bit; however, if _k_ is very high
the array will have more and more bits set to one as new elements are inserted, which
eventually will reach a point where we lose out to a filter with a lower _k_ and
thus a smaller proportions of set bits.

For given values of _n_ and _m_, the optimum _k_ is the integer closest to

[.text-center]
{small}stem:[k_{\text{opt}}=\displaystyle\frac{m\cdot\ln2}{n}]{small-end}

for a minimum FPR of
{small}stem:[1/2^{k_{\text{opt}}} \approx 0.6185^{m/n}]{small-end}. See the appendix
on xref:fpr_estimation[FPR estimation] for mode details.

== Variations on the Classical Filter

=== Block Filters

An operation on a Bloom filter involves accessing _k_ different positions in memory,
which, for large arrays, results in _k_ CPU cache misses and affects the
operation's performance. A variation on the classical approach called a
_block filter_ seeks to minimize cache misses by concentrating all bit
setting/checking in a small block of _b_ bits pseudorandomly selected from the
entire array. If the block is small enough, it will fit in a CPU cacheline,
thus drastically reducing the number of cache misses.

The downside is that the resulting FPR is worse than that of a classical filter for
the same values of _n_, _m_ and _k_. Intuitively, block filters reduce the
uniformity of the distribution of bits in the array, which ultimately hurts their
probabilistic performance.

A further variation in this idea is to have operations select _k_ blocks
with _k'_ bits set on each. This, again, will have a worse FPR than a classical
filter with _k&middot;k'_ bits per operation, but improves on a plain
_k&middot;k'_ block filter.

=== Multiblock Filters

_Multiblock filters_ take block filters' approach further by having
bit setting/checking done on a sequence of consecutive blocks of size _b_,
so that each block takes exactly one bit. This still maintains a good cache
locality but improves FPR with respect to block filters because bits set to one
are more spread out across the array.

Multiblock filters can also be combined with multi-insertion. In general,
for the same number of bits per operation and equal values of _n_ and _m_,
a classical Bloom filter will have the better (lower) FPR, followed by
multiblock filters and then block filters. Execution speed will roughly go
in the reverse order. When considering block/multiblock filters with
multi-insertion, the number of available configurations grows quickly and
you will need to do some experimenting to locate your preferred point in the
(FPR, capacity, speed) tradeoff space.
